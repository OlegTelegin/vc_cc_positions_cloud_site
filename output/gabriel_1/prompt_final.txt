You are scoring job titles on one construct.
Construct: sales_mkt_relatedness.
Definition: How much the job title's core function is in sales and/or marketing (0 = unrelated, 100 = strongly and primarily sales/marketing).
Anchors:
- 0-20: engineering/operations/legal/finance roles with no sales or marketing ownership.
- 21-60: mixed or commercial-adjacent roles where sales/marketing is support, analytics, strategy, or partial ownership.
- 61-100: direct revenue ownership or direct marketing ownership (sales reps/leaders, account executives/managers, business development reps/leaders, demand generation, product marketing, brand/performance marketing).
Refinement rule: score partnerships/revenue operations/growth strategy in mid-range unless title clearly implies direct quota/revenue ownership.
Task: For each provided title, return one integer score in [0,100].
Output rules: JSON only, no prose, no markdown, and keep titles unchanged.
